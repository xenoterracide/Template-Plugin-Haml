# ABSTACT: HAML plugin for Template Toolkit

=head1 NAME

Template::Plugin::Haml

=head1 VERSION

version 0.1.0

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	[%- USE Haml -%]
	[%- FILTER haml -%]
	%p Hello World
	[%- END -%]
	
    <p>Hello World</p>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A thin wrapper around L<Text::Haml> when you load the plugin it creates a
filter called haml that you can use in a normal way. A full descritption of
the Haml language can be found at
L<<a href="http://haml-lang.com/">haml-lang.com</a>>. Haml is a terse and
whitespace sensitive html, xhtml, and xml templating system. Compared to
Template Toolkit however it is relatively limited in what you can do. It by
itself contains no includes, conditionals, or loop constructs. So I've
combined it here with TT to make writing those kinds of templates with even
less code easier.

=head2 EXAMPLE

=head3 input template
B<wrapper.tt>

	!!! 5
	%html
	[% content %]

B<hello.tt>

	[%- message='Hello World' %]
	[%- USE Haml -%]
	[%- WRAPPER wrapper.tt | haml -%]
	[%- FILTER haml -%]
	 %head
	  %meta{:charset => "utf-8"}
	  %title hello
	 %body
	  %p [% message %]
	  %ul
	  [%- total=0; WHILE total < 5 %]
	   %li [% total=total+1 %][% total %]
	  [%- END -%]
	[%- END -%]

I'd like to draw some attention to the while loop here you have to have the
-'s in just the right spots to make it work because of Haml's whitespace
sensitivity.

It's also important to note that <tags> will be </closed> in the templates
they're in. If you used PROCESS instead of WRAPPER above your template would
be output like

	...
	<html></html>
	 <head>
	...

instead of...

=head3 Output

	<!DOCTYPE html>
	<html>
	 <head>
	  <meta charset='utf-8' />
	  <title>hello</title>
	 </head>
	 <body>
	  <p>hello world</p>
	  <ul>
	   <li>1</li>
	   <li>2</li>
	   <li>3</li>
	   <li>4</li>
	   <li>5</li>
	  </ul>
	 </body>
	</html>
